# School Management

Welcome to the School Management repository! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and how to contribute to the project.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  (version specified in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository:**
   - Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of this repository's page on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork:**
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G).
   - Click on "Clone Repository".
   - Enter your forked repository's URL and choose a local path to clone it to.

3. **Set up the upstream remote:**
   - In VS Code's terminal (Ctrl+`), add the upstream remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/chahidanas/schoolmanagement.git
     ```

4. **Create a virtual environment:**
   - Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

5. **Install dependencies:**
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```


## Contributing

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch:** `master`
- **Branch Naming Convention for Contributors:** `for-pull-request/<branch-name>`

### Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream:**
   - Before starting work, fetch changes from the original repository:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout master
     git merge upstream/master
     ```

2. **Create a new branch:**
   - Checkout a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b for-pull-request/my-feature
     ```

3. **Make your changes:**
   - Code, test, and document your changes thoroughly.

4. **Commit your changes:**
   - Stage your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
     ```

5. **Push your branch:**
   - Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin for-pull-request/my-feature
     ```

6. **Create a pull request:**
   - Visit your fork on GitHub.
   - Click on "Compare & pull request" next to your branch name.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes and submit the pull request.

7. **Accept and merge the pull request:**
   - As the repository owner or maintainer, review the pull request.
   - If approved, merge it into the `master` branch.

8. **Update your fork:**
   - Periodically sync your fork with the upstream repository to stay up-to-date:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     git checkout master
     git merge upstream/master
     git push origin master
     ```

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and conventions used throughout the project.
